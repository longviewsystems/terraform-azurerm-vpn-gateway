# Reporting a Vulnerability
Developers looking to report or address security issues in GitHub can do so through several ways. The main purpose of this guidance is to speed up the resolution of critical issues.

1. Create an `issue` in the repo.
2. Submit a `PR` describing the issue, along with proposed changes.

Depending on the outcome of the review, the vulnerability may be accepted or declined.

If you would prefer to chat with the repo author to triage or discuss offline prior to logging a vulnerability, please coordinate a MS Teams meeting invite.
